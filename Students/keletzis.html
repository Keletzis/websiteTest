        <h1>Personal Details</h1>
        
        <h2>Name:</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">Kosmas Keletzis</p>
        
        <h2>Date of Birth:</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">4th of June, 2000</p>
        
        <h2>Studies:</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">I study Computer Science at the City college of the the University of York in Thessaloniki.</p>
        
        <h2>Interests in Computer Science:</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Before comign to the college I had no prior experince with programming. However, since I started with my courses, I have gotten quite fond with programming and I have also gotten an interst about how computers work in general. In the future I would like to go deeper about how a computer works and thinks and also go into more detail about programming and learn to think like a programmer</p>
        
        <h2>Interests in general:</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Outisde of the college I have a number of hobbies like playing the guitar and in terms of sports, playing tennis. Since a small age I have been practising with the guitar, going to many concerts and now trying to start uploading on the internet themes of movies and games. In terms of sports, I started playing different sports as a kid, but the one that appealed to me the most and I still have enjoyment to this day is tennis. Other than that, I like watching movies and series as well as playing computer games.</p>
        
        <h2>Comments about my pages</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">As the leader of the team, I was responsible for making the home page of the website, the history and definition part and also one of the main implementations of the 4th Industrial revolution, the future of old jobs as well as the creation of new ones.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify">For all the html pages of the website, me as well all the rest of my collegues worked together on making a navigation bar on top of the page using html and CSS, a side menu using html CSS and Javascript and also a footer containing the most importand parts of our page. Some other things that we had in common was the up-Arrow which was made by me, and also the dark-light mode which was made by Ares.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify">In terms of the index home page, other than the standard html and CSS elements I created a div as a navigation bar where the user can see all the topics of the website and go to the one that he/she wishes. I had to ask my collegues for providing me a picture that would represent their topic, as well as a small sentence describing what the topic is mostly going to be focused on in order to fill it in the div. I also used some hover and transisition commands so that when you hover over the image the text appears from the bottom. Futhermore, I added a "Read More" button as a link to move to the page that the user desires. You will also notice that since there are 8 topics and each row contains 3 topics, I had to make an empty div in the middle of the 3rd row in order to have the other ones better aligned.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify">As for the History html file, some things that stand out are a number of links about specific photos like the three industrial revolutions, as well as a number of carousels using javascript that change the opacity of two to three images per div. The images are meant to represent things that are explained inside the paragraphs. For example, when I talk about the second Industrial revolution I mention some major changes that occured during that period and I also have the images by the side to change and show some of the main inventions of that time.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify">Finally, for the future and the past jobs that are going to go extinct and also be created, I have some more links that connect certain images to their original source as well a study which was made with the ain of examining what jobs will be created in the future and also which ones are in danger of going extinct. I am also using a modal image to show the result of the study even better. It also worth mentioning that throughout my pages I have links to my sources whenever needed.</p>
        
        <h2>Problems I faced and future work</h2>
        
        <p> There were a number of problems that I faced during the creation of my pages that I will want to change after the coursework in order to make the page look better. One of this problems was how responsive the pages were in general. Another problem that I faced was related to the carousels, where I wanted to put links in each photo that appeared. I was not able to click the links and I was told that I had to use in my CSS and Javascriot the z-index command. However, because of the lack of time I was not able to finish this correctly but I plan to have this problem addressed in the future. </p>
